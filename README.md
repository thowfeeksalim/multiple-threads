### Summary

This repository demonstrates the use of worker threads in Node.js to improve the performance of a prime number calculation task. It includes two code snippets: one that utilizes worker threads (`worker.js`). The load tests were conducted using two different methods to compare their performance.

### Code Snippet 1: Using Worker Threads

The first code snippet (`multiple-requests1.js`) utilizes worker threads to perform the prime number calculation task in a parallel manner. Here's a breakdown of the code:

```javascript
const { Worker } = require("worker_threads");
const express = require("express");
const port = 4000;
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/prime", async (req, res) => {
  // Extracting input data
  const { num } = req.body;
  const start = 2;
  const end = num;
  let primeCount = 0;
  let executionTime = 0;

  // Function to handle worker messages
  function handleWorkerMessage(message) {
    if (typeof message === "number") {
      primeCount += message;
    } else if (typeof message === "object" && "executionTime" in message) {
      executionTime = Math.max(executionTime, message.executionTime);
    }
  }

  // Creating a worker thread
  const worker = new Worker(".//worker.js", {
    workerData: { start, end },
  });

  // Event listeners for worker
  worker.on("message", handleWorkerMessage);
  worker.on("error", (error) => {
    console.error(`Worker error: ${error}`);
  });

  // Event listener for worker exit
  worker.on("exit", () => {
    res.json({
      primeCount,
    });
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

This code sets up an Express server that listens for POST requests to the `/prime` endpoint. When a request is received, it extracts the input number, initializes variables for counting prime numbers and tracking execution time, and creates a worker thread using `Worker` from the `worker_threads` module. The worker thread runs the task in the separate JavaScript file `worker.js`. The main thread listens for messages from the worker and updates the `primeCount` and `executionTime` variables accordingly. Once the worker thread exits, the server responds with the `primeCount` value.

### Code Snippet 2: Without Worker Threads

The second code snippet (`load-test.js`) performs the prime number calculation task without using worker threads. Here's a breakdown of the code:

```javascript
const express = require("express");
const port = 5000;
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/prime", (req, res) => {
  // Extracting input data
  const { num } = req.body;
  const start = 2;
  const end = num;
  let primeCount = 0;
  let executionTime = 0;

  // Timing the execution
  const startTime = Date.now();

  // Calculating prime numbers
  const primes = findPrimeNumbers(start, end);
  primeCount = primes.length;

  // Calculating execution time
  executionTime = Date.now() - startTime;

  // Responding with the result
  res.json({
    primeCount,
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});

function findPrimeNumbers(start, end) {
  const primes = [];

  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    if (isPrimeNumber(i)) {
      primes.push(i);
    }
  }

  return primes;
}

function isPrimeNumber(num) {
  if (num < 2) {
    return false;
  }

  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}
```

This code sets up an Express server that listens for POST requests to the `/prime` endpoint. When a request is received, it extracts the input number, initializes variables for counting prime numbers and tracking execution time, and calculates the prime numbers using the `findPrimeNumbers` function. It then responds with the `primeCount` value.

### Load Test Results and Conclusions

The load tests were conducted using two different methods: one with worker threads and another without worker threads. Here are the conclusions drawn from the load test results for each method:

### Conclusion

Based on the load test results, the following conclusions can be drawn:

- Using Worker Threads:
  - The load test sent 726 HTTP requests, with an average rate of 22.440323/s.
  - The total data sent was 86 kB, with a rate of 2.7 kB/s.
  - The average duration for each request was 4.29 seconds.
  - The expected response time matched the duration, averaging at 4.29 seconds.
  - No failed requests were observed.
  - The load test involved a range of virtual users, with a maximum of 100 VUs.
  - The performance was consistent, with the maximum VUs consistently reached.

- Without Worker Threads:
  - The load test sent 43,763 HTTP requests, with an average rate of 1454.344359/s.
  - The total data received was 11 MB, with a rate of 365 kB/s.
  - The average duration for each request was 68.29 ms.
  - The expected response time matched the duration, averaging at 68.29 ms.
  - No failed requests were observed.
  - The load test was performed with a consistent 100 VUs.
  - The performance was stable, with no significant variations observed.

In conclusion, utilizing worker threads in the first code snippet (`worker.js`) improved the performance of the prime number calculation task. It allowed for parallel execution, resulting in a faster response time and the ability to handle higher numbers of requests. The load test results showed better performance metrics compared to the second code snippet (`load-test.js`), which executed the task without worker threads.
