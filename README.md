This is a Node.js project that demonstrates how to use multiple threads in JavaScript to achieve parallel processing.

## Description

The purpose of this project is to showcase how to leverage the power of multiple threads in Node.js to perform computationally intensive tasks concurrently. It provides a simple example of creating and managing worker threads to distribute workload and improve overall performance.

## Features

- Creates multiple worker threads to execute tasks in parallel.
- Demonstrates how to communicate between the main thread and worker threads using messaging.
- Implements a basic load balancing strategy to distribute work evenly across threads.
- Provides an example of using thread pools to efficiently manage resources.

## Installation

To run this project locally, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/thowfeeksalim/multiple-threads.git

# Load Test Comparison

This repository contains two different implementations of a load test for a prime number calculation API. The load tests were executed using the k6 load testing tool. Below is a comparison of the two load tests and their conclusions.

## Load Test 1: Using Worker Threads

### Code Snippet 

```javascript


const { Worker } = require("worker_threads");
const express = require("express");
const port = 4000;
const app = express();
app.use(express.json());

app.post("/prime", async (req, res) => {
  const { num } = req.body;
  const start = 2;
  const end = num;
  let primeCount = 0;
  let executionTime = 0;

  function handleWorkerMessage(message) {
    if (typeof message === "number") {
      primeCount += message;
    } else if (typeof message === "object" && "executionTime" in message) {
      executionTime = Math.max(executionTime, message.executionTime);
    }
  }

  const worker = new Worker(".//worker.js", {
    workerData: { start, end },
  });

  worker.on("message", handleWorkerMessage);
  worker.on("error", (error) => {
    console.error(`Worker error: ${error}`);
  });

  worker.on("exit", () => {
    res.json({
      primeCount,
    });
  });
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`Server is running on http://localhost:${port}`);
});



```

### worker.js

```javascript


const { parentPort, workerData } = require("worker_threads");
//const fs = require("fs");

function findPrimeNumbers(start, end) {
  const primes = [];

  for (let i = start; i <= end; i++) {
    if (isPrimeNumber(i)) {
      primes.push(i);
    }
  }
  
  return primes;
}

function isPrimeNumber(num) {
  if (num < 2) {
    return false;
  }

  for (let i = 2; i <= Math.sqrt(num); i++) {
    if (num % i === 0) {
      return false;
    }
  }

  return true;
}

const startTime = Date.now();

const primes = findPrimeNumbers(workerData.start, workerData.end);
const primeCount = primes.length;

const executionTime = Date.now() - startTime;

parentPort.postMessage(primeCount);
parentPort.postMessage({ executionTime });



```

## Conclusion

By comparing the two load tests, we can draw the following conclusions:

1. Both implementations passed the load test with a status code of 200 for all requests.
2. The load test using Worker Threads (Load Test 1) had a lower data transfer rate compared to the load test without using Worker Threads (Load Test 2).
3. Load Test 1 had lower average HTTP request blocked time and connecting time compared to Load Test 2.
4. Load Test 1 had lower average HTTP request duration and expected response time compared to Load Test 2.
5. Load Test 2 had higher data received and data sent compared to Load Test 1.
6. Load Test 2 had higher average HTTP request receiving time and sending time compared to Load Test 1.
7. Both load tests had a 0% failure rate with no failed HTTP requests.
8. Load Test 2 had a higher average HTTP request waiting time compared to Load Test 1.
9. Load Test 1 had a higher average iteration duration compared to Load Test 2.
10. Load Test 2 had a higher average iteration rate compared to Load Test 1.
11. Both load tests utilized 100 virtual users (VUs) throughout the test, but Load Test 1 had a varying number of VUs ranging from 41 to 100.

# conclusion

Load Test 1 using Worker Threads demonstrated better performance in terms of lower response times and lower resource utilization compared to Load Test 2 without using Worker Threads. However, Load Test 2 achieved a higher iteration rate, which indicates higher throughput. The choice between the two implementations depends on the specific requirements and trade-offs of the application under test.
